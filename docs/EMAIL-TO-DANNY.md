Hi Danny,

Thanks for signing the NDA. As discussed, here are the complete technical documents and product overview for Aureus.

**Attached Document:**
- **AUREUS-FOR-iLOTTO-COMPLETE.md** — Complete documentation package including:
  - Product overview & business model
  - Technical architecture & smart contract specification
  - API integration wishlist (endpoints we expect from your white-label platform)

**Key Integration Points We Need:**
1. **Player Management:** Sync wallet addresses with white-label player accounts
2. **KYC/KYB:** Compliance verification hooks
3. **Ticket Purchase:** API for ticket sales integration
4. **Draw Management:** Webhook notifications for draw events
5. **Payouts:** Integration with your payment systems
6. **Reporting:** Analytics & compliance data export

**Next Steps:**
Please review the documentation and let me know:
1. Which APIs you can provide from your platform
2. Any gaps or additional requirements
3. Timeline for integration
4. When we can schedule a technical deep-dive call

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,  
Tim
